# Statement of Purpose


Building on the interactivity of geocaching apps, Tokyo Noire brings story-driven, geolocation-based scavenger hunts to mystery lovers.

Tokyo Noire is both a repository for players to find enthralling mysteries bridging fiction and real-life, and a platform for both amateur & professional writers to share short-form interactive adventures with thrill-seekers.

Our web app hopes to augment the way we view and interact with our environment, and invite more people to explore landmark, cities and neighbourhoods in new and exciting ways.
